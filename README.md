##  Key Features

- Creation of call and put options with customizable parameters
- Trustless P2P option contract selling and exercising
- On-chain enforcement of option expiry, strike price, and payout logic
- ERC-20 token-based settlement for compatibility with any DeFi asset

## Future Scope

- DAO-based risk management and fee sharing
- Premium discovery via auction or bonding curve
- Integration with Chainlink oracles for automated price-based settlements
- UI dashboard for visualizing open interest and exercising options
